# Bangla Speech Corpora

Bangla cleaned speech corpus, specially developed for [Bangla Text to Speech](https://github.com/Bangla-Language-Processing/Katha-Bangla-TTS) back in 2009. It is hosted orginally hosted in [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/blp/files/Speech_Corpora/).

## Characterstics of the corpus
This dataset consists of three different corpora and those were developed for three different purposes.

- **“Corpus for acoustic analysis”** was developed for acoustic analysis of Bangla phoneme inventory.
- **“Diphone corpus”** was developed for diphone concatenation based speech synthesis.
- **“Continuous speech corpus”** was developed for intonation model and unit selection based speech synthesis.

Other characterstics include:

- **Area of speech corpora:** Speech synthesis, phonetic research and speech recognition.
- **Spoken content:** Two approaches considered such as domain and phonological distribution.
- **Professional recording studio:** This is necessary for a clear acoustic signal from which it is possible to get clear acoustic information.
- **Speaking style:** Continuous read speech.
- **Manual segmentation:** Though this leads to significant amount of effort but it also affirm the
accuracy of the labeling.
- **Recording setup:** Supervised onsite recording.
